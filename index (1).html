        <center><h2><li>EXPERIENCE OUR IMPACT</li></h2></center>

        <center><b><p>To date, TRIBAL HEALTH has provided more than 1.2 million dollars in direct grants. Of course, the real impact is not measured in dollars and cents. It is reflected in the young mother who now has her own home and a dream to start her own business. It is felt by the disabled lady who no longer has to suffer the sweltering heat of a long, dry summer. It is honored by the Boy Scout Troop who decided to give half their new camping gear to a troop that was affected by Hurricane Katrina. We may never see most of the people whose lives have been made a little better by the small amounts that we give every two weeks, but we consider it an honor to support the local charities and their volunteers who do.</p></b></center>
